Train Scheduler
 
This application is used to add trains to a schedule. It then allows the user to see what time the trains are arriving. This application uses jquery, html, and a firebase api.  Firebase is what stores the data and allows the user to add new data to the website. Currently there is no way to delete the train data once it's been entered. It is only stored.   There is a calculation that is done through moment that allows the user to see the minutes until the train arrives. 

Moment is a date formatting web development tool. More about moment here: https://momentjs.com/.  

Most of the style formatting for this application was done using bootstrap. Learn more about bootstrap here: https://getbootstrap.com/ .

The deployed application can be found here.
