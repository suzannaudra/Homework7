 TrainSchedule
This application uses jquery and a firebase api.  Firebase is what stores the data and allows us to add new data to the website.  This application is used to add trains to a schedule to allow us to see what time the trains are arriving.  There is a calculation that is done through moment that allows us to see the minutes until the train arrives.
